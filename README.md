## Instructions

Select one card at a time, and try to match it to make a pair. The fewer moves you use, the more stars you will receive. Can you keep all three stars. Can you beat your previous time?

Use the restart arrow at anytime to start over.

When you match all the pairs, your game stats will be displayed. Choose to replay, or cancel.
